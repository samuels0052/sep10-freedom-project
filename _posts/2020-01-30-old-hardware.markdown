# Hardware
##### Radiographic X-Ray $35-130
* Used to observe tooth structure, bone damage, tooth positions, etc
* Can be used to determine the cause of tooth pain.
* Typically panoramic X Rays are used to check for wisdom teeth.
* Expose people to small amounts of radiation.

##### Resin Composite Fillings $150 per tooth
* Composite fillings are used in the treatment of cavities.  After bacteria and decayed structure is removed it is filled with an air-tight filling to prevent any further bacteria.
* Can last for up to 10 decades which makes them cost-efficient.
* Typically can be done in 1 visit.

##### Crowns $500-3,000
* A “cap” typically made out of porcelain that goes on top of a damaged tooth.
* Can last 20-30 years.
* Normally take 3 visits (prep, impression, seating of the permanent crown).
* Can be expensive.
* Can look completely natural and is very efficient.

##### Dentures $1500-15,000
* An appliance inserted into the mouth that replaces natural teeth.
* Last resort treatment after natural teeth are gone.
* Can be fit securely with implants placed into the mouth.
* Wear and tear will happen over time.
