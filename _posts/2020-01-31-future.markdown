# Future
##### Virtual dentistry
* A robot controlled by a dentist performs the dental treatments.
* The robot will automatically step away from the patient if the connection link goes down between the dentist and the robot.
* The dentist will have full control but the Robot can disobey orders for patient safety.
* Dentist wears VR glasses that also display patient data.
* Would be expensive to get a robot because of all the safety features.

##### No pain pill
* Analyzes the patient mouth to determine the right amount of antithetic to reliever.
* Can be controlled by computer to prevent overdoses.

##### AI Examiner
* An app that can use ai to tell patients if they need to go to a dental office.
* Would have a full mouthpiece that transmits data.
* Would let patients know if they need a cleaning.
* Will tell patients the state of their teeth.

##### 3d Printed Crowns
* Crowns are still made out of porcelain but 3d printed to make the cost cheaper.
* Wouldnâ€™t require as much work from a technician.
* Would be more time efficent.

##### Tooth Save Medicine
* Special medicine that can kill tooth bacteria without the need for a cavity to be removed or composite filling.
* The body would just take care of the damaged tooth and heal it.
