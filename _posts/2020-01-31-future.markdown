* The robot will automatically step away from the patient if the connection link goes down between the dentist and the robot.
* The dentist will have full control but the Robot can disobey orders for patient safety.
* Dentist wears VR glasses that also display patient data.
* Would be expensive to get a robot because of all the safety features. <br>
