I have been a dental assistant since June of 2022. I have gained valuable technical skills such as learning how to pour dental models and setting up patient rooms quickly. I really enjoy working with my co-workers and boss.

I have been coding discord bots for over a year. This has allowed me to gain knowledge with the [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Eris.js](https://abal.moe/Eris/docs/0.17.2/getting-started) libraries. Although most of my bots have been created for fun, in December of 2022 I participated in the Snow Codes Bot Jam and placed 7th overall with this [bot](https://github.com/code2cube/Ice-Cube-Bot).


I am inevitable.
